# Chess Wallet
A brain wallet that is rememberable.

Instead of remembering 24 words in a right order you have instead to remember the setup of a chessboard.
This setup will be the entropy to your 24 words/ to your bitcoins.

## Quality of entropy
A chessboard has 8 by 8 squares. Which equals 64 squares in totall.
There are 13 diffrent states(pieces being on them) one square can be in, including empty.
So there are 64^13 possible combinations.

This [entropy guide](EntropyGuide.md) instructs you on what to input.
